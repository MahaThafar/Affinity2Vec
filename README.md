## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

There are several required Python packages to run the code:
- gensim (for node2vec code)
- numpy
- Scikit-learn
- imblearn
- pandas

These packages can be installed using pip or conda as the follwoing example
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
----

### Files Description:
#### *There are Three folders:*

  **1.Input folder:** 
  that includes four folder for 4 datasets include: 
   - Nuclear Receptor dataset (nr),
   - G-protein-coupled receptor (gpcr),
   - Ion Channel (IC), 
   - Enzyme (e)
     which each one of them has all required data of drug-target interactions (in Adjacency matrix and edgelist format) and drug-drug and target-target similarities in (square matrix format) - all matrices include items names.
  
  **2.Embedding folder:**
  that has also four folders coressponding for four datasets,
     each folder contains the generated node2vec embeddings files for each fold of training data
     
  **3.Novel_DTIs folder:**
  that has also four folders coressponding for four datasets, 
     to write the novel DTIs (you should create directory for each dataset)
  
---
#### *There are 10 files:*
(Four main functions, one main for each dataset, and the other functions are same for all datasets which are imported in each main function)

- **load_datasets.py** --> to read the input data including interactions and similarities
- **get_Embedding_FV.py** --> to read the node2vec generated embedding and get the FV for each drug and target (CV random seed=22)
- **training_functions.py** --> for several training and processing functions such as edgeList, Cosine_similarity, ..
- **pathScores.py** --> to calculate and return all path scores for 6 path structures
- **snf_code.py** --> Similarity Network Fusion functions
- **GIP.py** --> to calculate and return gussian interaction profile similarity

- **Four main functions**
one for each dataset:
> - DTIs_Main_nr.py
> - DTIs_Main_gpcr.py
> - DTIs_Main_ic.py
> - DTIs_Main_enzyme.py

---
## Installing:

To get the development environment runining, the code get one parameter from the user which is the dataset name (the defual dataset is nr)
run:

```
python DTIs_Main_nr.py --data nr
```
```
python DTIs_Main_gpcr.py --data gpcr
```
```
python DTIs_Main_ic.py --data ic
```
```
python DTIs_Main_e.py --data e
```

------------------

#### The repositery also provides an example of seq2seq and ProtVec code implemented inside the DTBA prediction code in the folder (DTBA_Embeddings)

 ***About the folder (DTBA_Embeddings):***
 - This example is applied on Davis dataset

 - To run this code:
```
python DTIs_Main.py
```
 
 #### *Note:*
 >  When you run the code the AUPR result could be a little bit different than the other code (DTIs_Main_ic.py) because of randomness in seq2seq when generates the embedding
